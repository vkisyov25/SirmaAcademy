HotelRoomReservationSystem - A Java project for hotel reservation management.
This is a java application for booking hotel rooms which I developed for the Sirma Academy's Java Programming Course.
The goal was to create a hotel application which allows users to book and manage room reservations.
The project emphasizes the use of Java programming language for practicing and elevating fundamental skills as a Java developer.

You may run the project by executing the HotelApplication class on your favorite Java IDEA.
